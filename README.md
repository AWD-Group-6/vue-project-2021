# vue-project-2021

This project makes use of several services by element-plus and Apex Charts, therefore we have installed these as part of the development process. 
However, if you have cloned this project from Github, all the installs below should be included in the cloning process, therefore you can just enter two commands into the terminal to setup the project:

"npm install" & "npm run serve"

installed modules and statements: [
    npm install
    npm install --save vue-stripe-elements-plus
    npm install --save element-plus
    npm install --save vue-element-plus
    npm install --save apexcharts
    npm install --save vue3-apexcharts
    npm install --save firebase
    npm install --save unit-jest
]

(you can run "npm install --save vue-stripe-elements-plus element-plus vue-element-plus apexcharts vue3-apexcharts firebase unit-jest" but this makes it one install transaction that will all fail if one fails)

In this project you will find a Wireframe (Wireframe.drawio) documenting the preliminary visual goal of the site's pages and interconnectivity.
To open this wireframe, head to Draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/?libs=general;uml) and on the main screen select "File -> Open From -> Device" which will open your pc file explorer for you to select "Wireframe.drawio" to open it in the browser.
When you launch the server and navigate to localhost:8080 you will begin on the Home page and see a navigation bar at the top which will be the main source of navigation between pages.
